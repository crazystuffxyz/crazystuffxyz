## About Me 🚀

At 14, I’ve discovered my passion lies at the **intersection of mathematics and technology**. Since age five, I’ve been creating original formulas and exploring abstract concepts. My approach combines **theoretical insight** with practical implementation, building software that pushes boundaries while maintaining elegant simplicity.

**💻 Coding Enthusiast:** Crafting dynamic websites with:

* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS & Tailwind CSS** for style
* **JavaScript** for interactivity (typewriter & particle effects)
* **PHP** for server-side magic
* **Node.js** for scalable backend solutions

**🌱 Lifelong Learner:** Currently exploring the vast possibilities of Python and AI/ML.

**🎯 Mission:** To build innovative and user-friendly web experiences.

## Fun Fact ⚡

JavaScript can't install viruses, but it can download files, open mass amounts of windows, or run heavy loops that drain memory. Its true danger lies in social engineering—always stay vigilant. Prepend `view-source:` to inspect code, and be wary of `<script>` tags linking to obfuscated URLs.
