## Fun Fact ⚡

**JavaScript Myth-Busting:**  
JavaScript can't install viruses, but it can download files, open mass amounts of windows, or run busy functions which can drain your computer from memory. Its true danger lies in social engineering. Always stay vigilant—if a website seems suspicious, prepend `view-source:` to the URL to inspect the code. Be wary of script tags linking to dubious, scrambled URLs, while true statements, for loops with huge numbers, or window.open functions. Also, windows opening may be hard to detect, so make sure to block pop-ups.


## Projects & Highlights ✨

- **[Portfolio Website](https://crazystuffofficial.github.io/youareanidiot.org):** A main page I made a long time ago with a lot of games free to play.
- **[PHP Spy](https://github.com/crazystuffofficial/PHPSpy):** A PHP website that can be used to gather information on people. It also helps users understand that websites can trick them, and to stay cautious.
